A full-stack prototype of an anti-scam reporting platform, made for educational purposes as an extension of my final year project- Scam Busters - a Gen-AI Scam Campaign. This project focuses on documenting and categorising modern scam techniques such as deepfake, voice spoofing, and fake news, with the goal of helping others recognize patterns and identify & avoid potential scams.

<br>Features:
<ul>
<li>Submit structured scam reports</li>
<li>Categorised scam types (e.g. Deepfake, Voice Spoofing, Fake News)</li>
<li>Public feed of submitted reports</li>
<li>Timestamped entries</li>
<li>Mobile-first interface</li>
<li>REST API for data handling</li>
</ul>
