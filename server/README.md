A structured reporting system, it doesnt stop scam, but organizes it in hopes that others can understand patterns and avoid future scams that are similar. This app allows users to view others' experience, including the type of scam, which platform it occured on, a description of the scam, and when it happened and was reported. To upload your own experience, users are required to become registered users. Users submit structured incident reports into a system which adds it to the continuous list for others to read and get updated.
